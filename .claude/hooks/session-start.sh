# SessionStart hook: prepare the TypeScript and Go sides to build, lint
# and test. It installs ts/'s dependencies, the published engine among
# them, and warms the Go build cache; go.mod requires the published engine
# too. It also runs scripts/fetch-parser.sh, which fetches and builds the
# engine's GitHub main in vendor/, though nothing in the build reads
# vendor/ any more (AGENTS.md). rs/ needs a sibling ../parser checkout,
# which this hook does not provide. The tests bring their own small
# grammar.
#
# Runs only in Claude Code on the web (remote) sessions, which start from
# a fresh container. Safe to run repeatedly.

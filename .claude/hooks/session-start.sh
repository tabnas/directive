# engine — is not published to a registry, so it is fetched from GitHub
# main into vendor/ and the TypeScript/Go builds are wired to that copy.
# The tests bring their own small grammar.
#
# Runs only in Claude Code on the web (remote) sessions, which start from
# a fresh container. Safe to run repeatedly.
